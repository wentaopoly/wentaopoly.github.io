I am a PhD candidate (CIFRE) at [INSA](https://www.insa-rennes.fr/) and [Nokia Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/), focusing on language and reasoning models for telecom network management. I obtained my MSc from [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/) (Institut Polytechnique de Paris), where I ranked 1st in my cohort, and my BEng from [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/) through the SCUT-X 3+2 joint program.

My research interests lie in **LLM agents**, **Graph RAG**, **structured reasoning**, and their applications in real-world systems. During my internship at Nokia Bell Labs, I developed a Graph RAG system that achieved a 47.5% F1 improvement on the Corr2Cause benchmark. I also have experience in robotics (perception-navigation at the Chinese Academy of Sciences) and quantitative AI systems (real-time financial news analysis).

I am passionate about building intelligent systems that bridge the gap between large language models and domain-specific knowledge.
