        summary: Independently designed a real-time financial news intelligent analysis system (DataDig) for the global market.
        highlights:
          - "Built full async pipeline: Kafka consumer → LLM multi-dimensional feature extraction → 3-layer incremental clustering → event fusion, orchestrated by Dagster with 8-way parallel snippet extraction, incremental updates every 5 min (Python 15,000+ lines)"
          - "Designed 3-layer real-time clustering: Layer 1 HAC (cosine ≥ 0.8) deduplication; Layer 2 (≥ 0.6) semantic clustering with summary generation; Layer 3 LLM structured output (Pydantic Schema) for merge/new/ignore decisions, fusing real-time clusters into a 365-day long-term event table"
          - "Designed cross-cycle Cluster ID stability algorithm: Jaccard similarity UUID mapping + two-phase post-repair (anti-split/anti-merge) for stable cluster boundaries under incremental HAC; embedding stabilization (cosine ≥ 0.9 reuses old vectors) to suppress cascading effects from LLM phrasing variation"

        summary: Developed a Graph RAG system enhancing LLM reasoning through structured text generation.
        highlights:
          - "Achieved F1 improvement of 47.5% (32.71 → 48.26) on the Corr2Cause benchmark"
          - "Implemented 3-stage architecture: regex-constrained JSON tool calling with 100% schema compliance; knowledge graph construction with 95% entity precision and 92% disambiguation accuracy; NL-to-Cypher query with 100% syntax validity"
          - "Core innovation: hybrid BM25-vector retrieval for entity disambiguation, semantic-aware document chunking, Qwen3-32B-based tool calling and structured output, significantly reducing hallucination and improving multi-hop reasoning"
