  bio: >
    <p>I am a PhD candidate (CIFRE) at <a href="https://www.insa-rennes.fr/">INSA</a> and
    <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/">Nokia Bell Labs</a>, focusing on language and reasoning
    models for telecom network management. I obtained my MSc from
    <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/">École Polytechnique</a> (Institut Polytechnique de Paris),
    where I ranked 1st in my cohort, and my BEng from
    <a href="https://www.scut.edu.cn/">South China University of Technology</a>
    through the SCUT-X 3+2 joint program.</p>
    <p>My research interests lie in <strong>LLM agents</strong>, <strong>Graph RAG</strong>,
    <strong>structured reasoning</strong>, and their applications in real-world systems.
    During my internship at Nokia Bell Labs, I developed a Graph RAG system that achieved
    a 47.5% F1 improvement on the Corr2Cause benchmark. I also have experience in robotics
    (perception-navigation at the Chinese Academy of Sciences) and quantitative AI systems
    (real-time financial news analysis).</p>
    <p>I am passionate about building intelligent systems that bridge the gap between large
    language models and domain-specific knowledge.</p>
